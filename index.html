      <h1>BAND MEMBERS </h1>
  <h2>Seno Sejdic</h2>
      Drummer, 22. <br>
      He has been playing drums since he was a kid. Before Radarska Kontrola, him and Aldin had a band called "Siblings" because Seno and his brother played together with Aldin and his siste, hence the name "Siblings". Joined the band in 2016.
  <h2>Kerim Dubravic</h2>
  One of the founding members of trash metal band Radaraska Kontrola is Kerim Dubravić. Primarly bass player, occasional guitar player and back vocalist, Kerim is a part of band from
  the very beggining. Together with his best friend Emir Avdić, he dreamed about playing in a band, but as a guitar player. He was not so good as a lead guitar, so he switched to a bass 
  guitar, just like every single one bassist in the world. That was, as it seems, the best descision for him, since he proved to be good bass player, with a unique style, influeced mostly
  by Steve Harris of Iron Maiden. Kerim has been in the bend from its beggining, in 2015. He was mostly involved in managing bands gigs, since having a manager in early days of bands existance
  is not very common thing. He was also responsible for acquiring drummer Seno Sejdić to the band and later, together with Seno, acquiring new guitar player Aldin Đapo. Since Aldin joined
  the band, carrer went in uprising direction. Kerim is currently, together with other members in the band, working on a bands first album, which is announced for the end of the next year.
  <h2>Emir Avdic</h2>
  Emir Avdić was, together with Kerim Dubravić, the founding members of the band Radarska Kontrola. From their earliest age, they dreamed about havin a band and that idea was made true
in 2015, when the band Radarska Kontrola started to exist. Emir was always exceptional guitar player and fantastic singer. That is why he stepped up as a singer in the band, while playing 
ryhtm guitar along the process. He helped band in making a unique style, with high pitched chorus, screams, which are unique for Emir and for which he is recognisible. He is currently working 
on the bands first album, together with other members of the band.

hahah
  <h2>Aldin Djapo</h2>
      Aldin came to the band in summer 2018. His heavy sound brought the new dimension to the band. Heavy riffs and fast picking turned this band to a heavy metal band. He went to musical school for piano lessons but ended up playing a guitar. His inspiration comes from Metallica, Slayer, Ghost.
